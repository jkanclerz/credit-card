# Credit card 

This repository demonstrates the difference and synergy between user story and use case methodologies for software development. It provides practical examples of how user stories capture high-level goals from a user’s perspective, while use cases translate these goals into detailed system requirements and workflows.

By exploring these approaches side-by-side, the repository aims to help teams:
•	Understand when to use user stories vs. use cases.
•	Transition effectively from user needs to actionable system requirements.
•	Build robust, user-centered software with clear traceability between goals and implementation.
